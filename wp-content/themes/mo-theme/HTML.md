# HTML Principles

## Preserve WordPress theme files organization

WordPress has [a clear indication](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/) how to organize templates, template parts and template tags.

To keep the theme developer friendly this structure is used.

## Stable API

HTML class names and identifiers, template part names, and template tags are stable and consistent to ease future updates.

### HTML element attributes are generated

Every class name, element identifier, data attribute is generated instead of being added manually.
