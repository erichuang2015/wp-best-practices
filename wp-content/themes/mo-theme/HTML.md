# HTML Principles

## Preserve WordPress theme files organization

WordPress has [a clear indication](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/organizing-theme-files/) how to organize templates, template parts and template tags.

To keep the theme developer friendly this structure is used instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Semantic and outlined

The HTML source and outline is validated with the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)

## Stable API

HTML class names and identifiers, template part names, and template tags are stable and consistent to ease future updates.

### HTML element attributes are generated

Every class name, element identifier, data attribute is generated instead of being added manually.

Manual work is a bug. [Always be automating](https://morethemes.baby/2018/04/05/manual-work-is-a-bug-always-be-automating-a-b-a/).
